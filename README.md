In the P1.py file you will see the underlying code in python used to conduct the experiments.

Here's how the code works:

- There are two main functions: 
        rep_pres_exp (stands for "repeated presentations experiment")
        sin_pres_exp (stands for "single presentations experiment")

- Each of these functions calls helper functions in order to perform the necessary work
    described in the 5-page write-up.

- Once the main functions produce their RSE outputs, the graph section produces each of:
        Figure 3
        Figure 4
        Figure 5

For any questions or comments, I'd love to hear them! This has been a wonderful project.
    Never thought replicating a RL paper would be this interesting.
